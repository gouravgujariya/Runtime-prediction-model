## Summarry

Time complexity is the measure of how quickly an algorithm completes a task. It is defined as the amount of time that takes to execute an algorithm on input size `n` with memory requirement `M` and processing capability `P`, i.e., T(n, M, P) = O(n). In other words, its equivalent to the notation of "O(n)" algorithms in the machine learning field. 
This research aims to provide an automation tool that can compute the time complexity of a given operation based on algorithmic features present in the code. This calculation is done manually, which results in human error and not being able to get an approximate assumption before creating the algorithm about their computational complexity.

We will be using the corcod dataset [1] and Google Colab as a platform to work with the dataset and model. We will be looking into a dataset and seeing if any feature is not important to the model or imbalanced. For multiclass classification, we will be using algorithms that are helpful, including Random Forest Classifier, K-nearest Classifier, and SVM. 
The following study shows the classifiers are trained and tested for the complexity of a given dataset. The proposed approach achieved an accuracy of 74.28%, which is much higher than the existing methods. The supervised mechanism is used to exemplify the use of several classifiers for employment scam detection. Experimental results indicate that the extra tree classifier outperforms its peer classification tool.
