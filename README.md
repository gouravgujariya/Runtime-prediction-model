[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Overview
The Runtime Prediction Tool is a project aimed at predicting the runtime of code based on its features, such as loops, if statements, and functions. This tool is designed to assist researchers in saving time during the runtime analysis of brute force algorithms or other approaches by providing faster predictions of time complexity.

## Key Features
- Utilizes ensemble methods for runtime prediction
- Provides a research paper on the study of runtime prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Setup Instructions
To use the Runtime Prediction Tool, follow these steps:
1. Download the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Set up the notebook in Google Colab.
3. Download the dataset required for runtime prediction.
4. Install the necessary libraries and run the notebook.

## Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions to the project. If you would like to contribute, you can:
